This application is an API with some basic concepts such as:

- Sign-up / Sign-in (advanced one with access and refresh jwt token)
- There are two types of users [blogger, admin]
- Posts can be published or hidden
- Bloggers / admins can create/read/update/delete posts 
- Admin can remove any public post

As infrastructure i've used Node JS with the express framework, as database i used PostgreSQL and Docker to "containerize the app"

- Typescript
- Sequelize
- Jwt
- Docker / Docker-Compose
